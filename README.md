# Diabetes-Prediction---Data-Mining

High Level light on the work :-

Problem:
Wrong prediction of diabetes has been a huge issue. Diabetic and Non-diabetic patients labeled as opposite can be prove to be devastating to the health.

Project :
Models have been trained for accurate prediction of diabetic and non-diabetic datapoints. Different Pre-processing techniques such as imputation, scaling down of features, over sampling have been applied to the dataset for enhancing predictive capabilities of the model. 

Future work :
- Using various other Pre-processing techniques, 
- Once done with the current problem moving on to Type-1 and Type-2
prediction exactness. 
- Developing a Web App using some backend framework such as Flask or Django in Python and Frontend.
